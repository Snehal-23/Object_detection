# Object_detection
This project is Object detection using Python OpenCV.
The Yolov3 algorithm is implemented here with simple code.
Also the the weights and cfg files need to be downloaded to make this project work.
You can download the weights and cfg using this link- https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ 
In order for code to run, the parameters such as input image or video and location for storing is required to be mentioned in terminal. 
That command is written in comments above the code.
Steps to implement this project.
1. Download the repository.
2. Download yolov3.cfg and yolov3.weights files and store them in yolo-coco folder for easy access.
3. Run the code in terminal provides input image after --image parameter and enjoy the magic.
